```
Hey builders!

Super excited for Friday's 12-hour sprint. Quick but important setup:

🎯 COME WITH AN IDEA (even rough)
We'll refine it together at 10am, but don't show up blank. Think about:
- What problem annoys you?
- What could be better in your daily life?
- What would take you 5 mins to explain?

💻 REQUIRED SETUP - DO THIS BEFORE 9AM FRIDAY
[ ] Git installed + GitHub account created
    → https://git-scm.com/downloads
    → https://github.com/signup

[ ] Cursor OR Windsurf downloaded
    → https://cursor.sh (recommended)
    → https://codeium.com/windsurf (alternative)

[ ] Node.js installed (v18 or higher)
    → https://nodejs.org/en/download

[ ] Python installed (v3.10 or higher)
    → https://www.python.org/downloads

[ ] Firebase account created
    → https://firebase.google.com
    → Sign up with Google account

[ ] Supabase account created
    → https://supabase.com
    → Sign up with GitHub account

💰 BUDGET RECOMMENDATION
Plan for ~$20-30 in AI tool credits:
- Cursor Pro: $20/month (cancel anytime)
- OR use free tier conservatively

⚡️ WHAT TO EXPECT
- Your idea WILL get simplified (that's good)
- You'll build a working prototype, not a polished product
- We'll actively stop you from overbuilding
- Hard deadlines at 12pm (idea lock) and 6pm (feature freeze)

🚫 WHAT WON'T WORK IN 12 HOURS
- "The next Instagram/Uber/TikTok"
- Multiple user types (admin, user, moderator, etc.)
- Hardware/IoT projects
- Anything requiring 3rd party API approvals
- Mobile apps (stick to web)
