# Demo Format - Science Fair Style

**Time:** 8:00-10:00pm (2 hours)
**Format:** Science fair (NOT stage presentations)
**Goal:** Interactive, energetic, conversational demos

---

## Why Science Fair vs Stage Presentations?

### ❌ Stage Presentations (Don't Do This)
- Exhausting after 12 hours of coding
- Everyone must sit through 15+ demos
- Pressure-filled, formal
- People zone out after demo #5
- Takes forever (15 demos × 5 mins = 75+ mins)

### ✅ Science Fair Style (Do This)
- Interactive and conversational
- People walk around at their own pace
- See 5-10 demos instead of all of them
- Less formal, more fun
- Demos happen simultaneously (15 demos in 90 mins)
- Repeat demos → practice makes perfect

---

## Setup (7:45-8:00pm)

### Physical Arrangement

**Each person/team:**
1. **Stays at their desk/table**
2. **Laptop open with project running on localhost**
3. **Browser ready** (demo-ready state)
4. **Unnecessary tabs closed**
5. **Optional:** Small sign with project name (index card)

**Your tasks:**
- Ensure everyone has space to accommodate 3-5 viewers
- Test: Can people move between stations easily?
- Set up voting station (see below)

---

## The Demo Flow (8:00-9:30pm)

### How It Works

**90 minutes of continuous demoing:**

1. **Builders stay at their stations**
2. **Viewers walk around** (organizers, participants, guests)
3. **Each demo is ~2 minutes**
4. **Builders repeat demo 5-10 times** to different audiences

**Rotation strategy:**
- First 45 mins: Everyone demos, everyone views (take turns)
- Last 45 mins: Open exploration

---

### Demo Script Template (Share This at 7:30pm)

**Each demo should follow this structure:**

```
[15 seconds] - THE PROBLEM
"I built [project name]. It solves [specific problem]."

Example:
"I built TaskSnap. It helps people quickly capture tasks from
screenshots instead of manual typing."

[15 seconds] - THE SOLUTION
"Here's how it works: [one-sentence explanation]"

Example:
"You upload a screenshot, it extracts text, and creates
a todo list automatically."

[90 seconds] - LIVE DEMO
Show the happy path, one complete flow.
No explanations of code, just user perspective.

Example:
1. Upload screenshot
2. Show extracted text
3. Display generated tasks
4. Done.

[Optional 30 seconds] - Q&A
If viewers have questions.
```

### Demo Prep Checklist (7:30-8:00pm)

**Help participants prepare:**

✅ **Test your demo flow 3 times**
- Does it work end-to-end?
- What could break?
- Have a backup plan

✅ **Clear your screen**
- Close error consoles
- Close extra tabs
- Hide messy code
- Full screen the demo

✅ **Prepare your 2-sentence intro**
- Practice saying it out loud
- Time yourself (should be ~30 seconds)

✅ **Have localhost running and stable**
- Don't restart servers during demos
- Test: refresh the page, does it work?

✅ **Prepare a fallback**
- Screenshots if live demo breaks
- Verbal walkthrough as backup
- Don't panic if something fails

## Viewing Strategy (For Participants)

**Each participant should:**

1. **Demo their project when viewers come** (stay at station)
2. **When no one is viewing, go explore others' projects**
3. **Aim to see 5-10 projects** (not all, that's too many)
4. **Vote for your favorites** (see voting section)

**As facilitator, encourage:**
- Movement (don't cluster at one station)
- Questions (make it conversational)
- Positive feedback ("This is cool because...")

---

## Voting System (9:30-9:45pm)

### Categories

**3 voting categories:**

1. **People's Choice** - Most useful/popular
2. **Most Ambitious** - Biggest scope attempted (even if incomplete)
3. **Best Technical** - Cleanest implementation

### Voting Mechanism

**Option A: Sticker Voting (Recommended)**
- Each person gets 3 stickers (different colors for each category)
- Place stickers on index cards at each station
- Cannot vote for yourself
- Visual, fun, quick

**Option B: Google Form**
- Pre-create form with all project names
- Each person submits votes
- Tabulate at end

**Option C: Hand Voting**
- For each category, nominees raise hands
- Group votes by applause/hand raises
- Fastest but least precise

---

### Vote Counting (9:30-9:45pm)

**While people are wrapping up:**
- Count votes quickly
- Prepare to announce winners
- Have small prizes ready (if any)

---

## Wrap-Up & Celebration (9:45-10:00pm)

### Announce Winners (5 mins)

```
"Okay everyone, gather around!

First, huge round of applause for everyone.
You just built a working prototype in 6 hours. That's incredible.

Winners:

🏆 PEOPLE'S CHOICE: [Project Name] - [One sentence description]
🏆 MOST AMBITIOUS: [Project Name] - [One sentence description]
🏆 BEST TECHNICAL: [Project Name] - [One sentence description]

Come grab your [prizes/certificates/bragging rights]"
```

---

### Quick Debrief (5 mins)

**Ask the group:**

1. **"What worked well today?"**
   - Let 2-3 people share quick wins
   - Celebrate the GPT assistants, checkpoints, etc.

2. **"What would you do differently?"**
   - Let 2-3 people share learnings
   - Common themes: "I should have simplified earlier"

3. **"What surprised you?"**
   - Usually: "I built more than I thought I could" OR "It was harder than expected"

---

### Group Photo (2 mins)

- Gather everyone
- Laptops with projects visible (optional)
- Take multiple shots
- Share in group chat later

---

### Final Words (2 mins)

```
"A few final things:

1. Your projects are v0.1, not finished products.
   That's perfect. That's the point.

2. If you want to keep building, do it!
   But take a break first.

3. [If you set up a Discord/Slack]
   Join [community] to share updates.

4. Thank you for your energy today.
   This was a success because you all committed to the process.

Safe travels home. See you next time!"
```

## Facilitation Tips for Demo Time

### Energy Management

**Keep energy high:**
- Play background music (optional, low volume)
- Encourage applause after demos
- Celebrate "wow" moments loudly
- Move around, don't stand in one spot

**Watch for:**
- Tired, defeated energy → Inject enthusiasm
- People sitting alone → Pull them into conversations
- Wallflowers not demoing → Encourage them gently

---

### Handling Demo Failures

**If someone's demo breaks:**

**Don't:** Make a big deal, show pity
**Do:** "No problem! Tell us what it was supposed to do."

**Encourage fallback:**
- Screenshots
- Verbal walkthrough
- Show the code (if they're proud of it)

**Normalize it:**
"Half of all live demos break. That's tech. What matters is you built it."

---

### Encouraging Quiet Builders

**Some people won't want to demo:**
- Embarrassed their project is "too simple"
- Perfectionist shame ("it's not done")
- Shy about presenting

**Your script:**
```
"Hey, can I see what you built?

[View their demo]

This is great! [Specific thing you like]

You should show this to others.
It doesn't have to be perfect. Everyone's in the same boat.

Just show them this part, it works well."
```

**Then:** Bring someone else over to see their demo. Social proof helps.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "What if my demo only works 50% of the time?"**
A: "Show the happy path when it works. If it breaks, explain what should happen. That's fine."

**Q: "Can I show my code instead of the UI?"**
A: "Only if the code is the interesting part (e.g., algorithm). Otherwise, show the user experience."

**Q: "Do I need to deploy it?"**
A: "No. Localhost demos are 100% valid. Don't waste time deploying."

**Q: "What if I didn't finish?"**
A: "Demo what you did finish. Or demo what you learned. Both are valid."

**Q: "How technical should I get?"**
A: "User perspective, not technical deep-dive. Save code explanations for people who ask."

## Success Metrics for Demos

### Great Demo Session:
- High energy, lots of conversation
- People genuinely curious about each other's work
- Laughter, excitement, "wow" moments
- Voting is close (many good projects)
- People stay until 10pm voluntarily

### Good Demo Session:
- Most people demo their work
- Positive feedback exchanged
- Some excitement
- People leave satisfied

### Warning Signs:
- Low energy, people leaving early
- Demos are silent (no questions/feedback)
- Only a few people demo
- Rushed feeling

---

## Post-Event (Optional)

### If You Want to Extend the Experience:

**Share publicly:**
- Group photo on social media
- Recap blog post
- Shoutouts to winners

**Community building:**
- Create Discord/Slack for continued learning
- Monthly meetups
- Next buildathon date

**Feedback collection:**
- Quick Google Form survey
- What worked, what didn't
- Ideas for next time

---

**Remember:** The demo session should feel celebratory, not judgmental. Everyone who built something deserves applause.
