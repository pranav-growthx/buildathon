3. **Point to cheat sheets:** "Grab one of these"
4. **Setup issues?** Direct to helper desk
5. **Offer:** "Coffee/water over there"

---

### Common Setup Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Git not installed**
- **Quick fix:** Send to git-scm.com/downloads
- **Time:** 10-15 mins
- **Backup:** They can commit later, start coding first

**Issue 2: Cursor/Windsurf not installed**
- **Quick fix:** cursor.sh or codeium.com/windsurf
- **Time:** 5-10 mins
- **Backup:** Use VS Code with Copilot temporarily

**Issue 3: Node.js not installed**
- **Quick fix:** nodejs.org/en/download
- **Time:** 10 mins
- **Backup:** Use Python/FastAPI stack instead

**Issue 4: No Firebase/Supabase account**
- **Quick fix:** Create during ideation phase (10am-12pm)
- **Not blocking:** Accounts can be created later

**Issue 5: No project idea**
- **Response:** "That's fine, we're brainstorming at 10am. Think about what annoys you."

---

### 9:45am: Final Prep (15 mins before start)

**Quick team huddle (if you have helpers):**

- Review timeline briefly
- Share any last-minute observations

**Mental prep:**
- Take 5 deep breaths
- Review your opening remarks
- Trust your preparation

---

## 10:00am: Event Kickoff

### Opening Remarks (5 mins)

**Stand where everyone can see you:**

```
"Good morning everyone! Welcome to the buildathon.

Quick logistics:
- Wifi: [Point to credentials]
- Bathrooms: [Point]
- Food: Lunch at 12:30pm, snacks throughout
- Questions: Ask me or [helpers]

Here's the deal:

You have 12 hours. That's not much.
Most of you came with big ideas. That's good.
But we're going to make them MUCH smaller. That's also good.

Timeline (point to whiteboard):
- Now-12pm: Ideation - use Validator GPT (scan QR codes)
- 12pm: HARD LOCK - no idea changes after this
- 12:30pm: Lunch
- 1:30pm: Coding starts
- 6pm: FEATURE FREEZE - only bug fixes after
- 7:30pm: CODE COMPLETE - no more coding
- 8pm: Demos - science fair style

Hard rules:
1. Use Validator GPT - seriously, everyone
2. Cursor + Firebase OR Supabase only
3. When you're stuck, use Debugger GPT
4. Commit your code every 30 mins
5. No perfect code - working prototype wins

Goal today: Working v0.1 prototype.
Not finished product. Not polished.
Just: Does the core thing work?

Questions?"

[Answer 2-3 quick questions]

"Okay, start with Validator GPT.
Scan QR codes around the room or use links in chat.

Paste your output in the shared doc [show QR code].

Let's go!"
```

## Mental Readiness

### Your Mindset for Today

**Remember:**
- You've prepared well (GPTs, timeline, materials)
- You'll adapt on the fly
- Not everyone will finish - that's okay
- Your job: Maximize working prototypes
- Some will struggle despite your help - that's normal
- Trust your intervention instincts

---

### Energy Management

**You're on for 13 hours (8:30am-10pm):**

**Micro-breaks (5 mins each):**
- Take them every 90 mins
- Step outside
- Stretch
- Hydrate

**Lunch:**
- Actually eat
- Don't work through lunch
- You need energy for afternoon/evening

**4pm energy dip:**
- Expect it
- Coffee/walk helps
- Group energy reset helps everyone

---

### Communication Style Today

**Be:**
- Direct (not harsh, but clear)
- Opinionated (you know what works)
- Encouraging (celebrate small wins)
- Realistic (don't sugarcoat if someone's behind)

**Don't be:**
- Hands-off (you're actively involved)
- Overly nice (false hope hurts)
- Perfectionist (working > perfect)
- A code-writer (guide, don't do)

---

## Final Check Before 9am

**Take 2 mins:**
- [ ] Deep breaths
- [ ] Quick venue walkthrough
- [ ] Everything posted and ready

"I've built the systems.
Today is execution and adaptation.
Let's make this great."

- [ ] Appreciate what you pulled off

You just facilitated a 12-hour buildathon.

**Well done.**
