### Cheat Sheet QR Integration

**Add QR codes inline with text:**

```
🤖 GPT ASSISTANTS

[Validator QR]  Validator: Scope your idea
[Debugger QR]   Debugger: Fix bugs efficiently
[Stack QR]      Stack Advisor: Pick tools
[Coach QR]      Timeline Coach: Stay on track
```

**Size:** 1-2 inches square (must be scannable)

---

## Testing QR Codes

**Before printing, test EVERY QR code:**

✅ **Scan with phone camera**
- iPhone: Just point camera
- Android: Point camera or use Google Lens

✅ **Verify destination**
- Opens correct GPT?
- Opens correct Google Doc?
- No login required to access?

✅ **Test from different distances**
- Should scan from 1-2 feet away
- If too small, increase size

✅ **Test in different lighting**
- Bright room
- Dimmer room
- Ensures contrast is good

---

## Printing Guidelines

### Size Recommendations

**Large posters (GPT posters):**
- QR code: 4x4 inches minimum
- Total poster: 8.5x11" or 11x17"
- Scannable from 3-4 feet away

**Cheat sheet (handout):**
- QR code: 1x1 inch minimum
- Scannable from 1-2 feet away

### Print Quality

- **Resolution:** 300 DPI minimum
- **Color:** High contrast (black QR on white/bright background)
- **Paper:** Any, but bright colored paper helps visibility

---

## File Organization

**Save QR codes in folder:**

```
qr-codes/
├── validator-gpt-qr.png
├── debugger-gpt-qr.png
├── stack-advisor-gpt-qr.png
├── timeline-coach-gpt-qr.png (if created)
├── shared-doc-qr.png
└── poster-designs/
    ├── validator-poster.pdf
    ├── debugger-poster.pdf
    └── stack-advisor-poster.pdf
```

## Where to Place QR Codes on Event Day

### High Visibility Locations

**Entrance:**
- Validator GPT poster
- Welcome message with shared doc QR

**Helper Desk:**
- All GPT QR codes
- Shared doc QR

**Around Room (walls):**
- Tech stack decision tree with Stack Advisor QR
- Debugger GPT poster

**On Handouts:**
- Cheat sheet with all QRs
- Small QRs inline with relevant sections

**On Whiteboard (optional):**
- Write short links or show QRs on projector

---

## Backup: Short Links

**If QR codes fail (rare but possible):**

Create short links with bit.ly:
- bit.ly/buildathon-validator
- bit.ly/buildathon-debugger
- bit.ly/buildathon-stack
- bit.ly/buildathon-doc

Write these on whiteboard as backup.

---

## Troubleshooting

**QR code won't scan:**
- Increase size (4x4 inches minimum for distance scanning)
- Increase contrast (black on white works best)
- Reprint on non-glossy paper
- Ensure good lighting at venue

**Opens wrong link:**
- Regenerate QR code
- Double-check URL before generating
- Test again before reprinting

**Participants can't access GPT:**
- They need ChatGPT account (free is fine)
- GPT must be set to "Anyone with link" access
- Share backup: direct URL in chat

---

## Post-Event

**Save all QR codes and links for:**
- Next buildathon
- Sharing in post-event materials
- Including in follow-up email

---

## Quick Checklist

**Day of printing (Jan 15-16):**

- [ ] All GPT links copied
- [ ] All QR codes generated
- [ ] All QR codes tested (scanned with phone)
- [ ] Posters designed
- [ ] Posters printed
- [ ] Cheat sheets with QRs printed
- [ ] Backup short links created
- [ ] QR files backed up

---

**Remember:** Test every QR code before printing. A broken QR code on event day creates unnecessary friction.
