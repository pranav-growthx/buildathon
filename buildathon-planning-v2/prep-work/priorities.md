## 2. Ideas (Prioritized)

### CRITICAL (Must Implement)

1. ✅ **Validator GPT** - Prevents "building Google" problem
2. ✅ **Tech Stack Lockdown** - Cursor + Firebase/Supabase only
3. ✅ **Git Safety Net** - Pre-configured repos with `.cursorrules`
4. ✅ **Timeline Enforcement** - Hard gates at key moments
5. ✅ **Debugger GPT** - Stops token waste on "fix it" prompts

### HIGH VALUE (Implement If Time)

6. ✅ **Stack Advisor GPT** - Helps pick right tools
7. ✅ **Team Clustering** - Group similar domains at lunch
8. ✅ **Public Checkpoints** - 3pm and 6pm progress shares
9. ✅ **Live Demos** - You demo at 1:30pm and 5:15pm
10. ✅ **Science Fair Demos** - Not oral presentations

### NICE TO HAVE

11. ⚠️ **Timeline Coach GPT** - Keeps people on schedule
12. ⚠️ **One-page Cheat Sheet** - Quick reference for common tasks
13. ⚠️ **Starter Templates** - One Firebase, one Supabase template
14. ⚠️ **Cue Cards** - Teams ask each other questions

## 3. Prep Work (Jan 6-17)

### Week 1: Jan 6-12 (Build Core Systems)

#### Day 1-2: GPT Creation (4 hours total)

- Build Validator GPT (1.5 hours)
- Build Debugger GPT (1 hour)
- Build Stack Advisor GPT (1 hour)
- Test with 3-5 sample scenarios (30 mins)

#### Day 3-4: Technical Infrastructure (5 hours)

- Create decision tree one-pager for tech stack
- Setup starter repos with `.cursorrules`
- Create `.env.example` files with clear comments
- Test end-to-end: clone → setup → deploy

#### Day 5: Documentation (2 hours)

- Create one-page cheat sheet (Git, Cursor, Firebase/Supabase basics)
- Write "Fake It License" poster (allowed shortcuts)
- Prepare banned tools list

#### Day 6-7: Communication (1 hour)

- Draft and send pre-event setup email (see below)

### Week 2: Jan 13-16 (Polish & Prepare)

#### Day 8-9: Physical Materials (3 hours)

- Print decision tree
- Print cheat sheets
- Create QR codes for GPT links
- Print "Fake It License" poster
- Prepare cue cards
- Setup shared doc for problem statements

#### Day 10: Dry Run (2 hours)

- Walk through timeline with a friend
- Test GPTs with realistic scenarios
- Verify all links and repos work

#### Day 11: Buffer Day

- Handle any last-minute issues
- Rest and prepare mentally

### Day Of: Jan 17th (Setup)

#### 8:30am: Venue Setup

- TV/projector with countdown timer running
- Setup helper desk with laptop
- Post posters: Tech stack decision tree, Fake It License, GPT QR codes
- Test internet connectivity
- Setup photo area with whiteboard

## 4. Good to Haves (Only If Extra Time)

### Lower Priority Enhancements

- **Meta-GPT router** - Front desk that routes to specialist GPTs
- **NotebookLM post-event podcast** - Reflective content after buildathon
- **Curated video links** - With specific timestamps on cheat sheet
- **Multiple starter templates** - Django, Next.js variations
- **Slack/Discord channel** - For pre-event questions
- **Recorded Git basics video** - 10-min pre-event tutorial

### Things That Sound Good But Skip

- ❌ Creating video tutorials (NotebookLM or otherwise)
- ❌ Fancy documentation beyond one-pager
- ❌ Multiple tool tutorials
- ❌ Perfect deployment guides (localhost is fine)
- ❌ Single install script (too risky, send checklist instead)

---

## 5. Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

### Don't Do These Things

1. ❌ **Hourly buzzers** - Annoying, use visual timer instead
2. ❌ **Oral presentations** - Exhausting after 12 hours
3. ❌ **Making deployment mandatory** - Localhost demos are valid
4. ❌ **Allowing no-code tools** - rocket.new, lovable, etc. hide the code
5. ❌ **Being hands-off** - Walk around constantly, intervene early
6. ❌ **Letting people pivot after 3pm** - Too late, help them salvage
7. ❌ **Video content creation** - Time sink with low ROI
8. ❌ **Polished materials over working systems** - GPTs > documentation
9. ❌ **Loose timelines** - Hard gates are essential
10. ❌ **Assuming people watch pre-event content** - They won't

### Red Flags to Stop Immediately

- Building multiple user types
- Creating admin dashboards
- Perfect authentication flows
- CSS/styling rabbit holes
- "Making it pretty" before it works
- Deployment issues eating hours
- Scope creep after 6pm
- People restarting from scratch after 4pm

### Your Role: Be the "Wise Blocker"

Every hour, walk around asking:

- "What's the ONE thing your prototype must do?"
- "Show me what's working right now"
- "Is this the core soul or a nice-to-have?"

If you see:

- **Blank stares** → They're stuck, intervene
- **Frantic Googling** → Wrong approach, redirect
- **Many tabs open** → Scope creep, refocus
- **Nothing working at 3pm** → Time to pivot or simplify
